# Time-Calculator

The use case for this time calculator is very particular, but maybe someone can find this useful! I had created a mixtape and wanted to add captions within Windows Movie Maker whenever the song changed. Windows Movie Maker only allows you to add captions based on start time and duration. This program will ask for the number of songs, the time stamp of the song change, and the total duration of the mixtape. Note that the time stamp of each song must be entered with minutes and seconds in seperate entries. EX: Song 2 changes at 2:40, enter 2, then enter 40. Hope someone finds this useful!
